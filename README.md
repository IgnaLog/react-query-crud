# React Query - CRUD Operations

This is a simple example of using React Query, whereby we perform CRUD operations on a backend built with json-server.

With React Query we can make CRUD requests while the data is kept in the global state of the frontend and in this way manipulate it easily.

## ðŸ’» Quick start

To deploy this project, you must first install the node_modules packages. To do this, open a console with the main path of the project and run:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the backend with json-server, open a new terminal and in the main project path run:
